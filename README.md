## Usage
Listivity is an application that tracks social activity ideas for users. As they think of them, users will input their data for social activities they donâ€™t want to forget. 

When a user signs-up or logs in, they are presented with three categories: Activities, Dining and Entertain. When a user submits their inputs in a given field, their idea will be saved as a card under that tab. Each activity is able to be edited and deleted, using assigned buttons at the bottom of each card. 

If user's to do not want to select an activity themselves, they are able to click the "shuffle" button at the top of the page. The site will sort through the user's stored data and present them with an activity. 

The user's inputs are stored in a MYSQL database and retrieved the next time a user logs into their account.

## Future Development
In the future, the application will grow to include a search function for the user. Instead of user input, the user can search for a restaurant, recipe, activity or movie and save it to their profile. 

Additional functionality, like a "share" button, will be created that allows users to share their activity list with friends.
